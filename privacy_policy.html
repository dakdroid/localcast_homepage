    <h1>Privacy policy for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=4965522548888268835">all Android apps made by Stefan Pledl.</a></h1>
    <br>
<p>In order to access private data, the app needs a permission. The following is structered by Android permission and applies only if the app needs one of the permissions.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Permission: "Identity/Contacts - find accounts on the device"
    </h3>
    <p>(e.g. LocalCast, Drummer's Metronome, Private Cam, Whisper or Beat)</p>
   
    <p>In order to log you into several Google services like Google Drive or Google Photos, the app can display all accounts and lets you choose one. The accounts are only used for this purpose. The app won't send the accounts to a 3rd party.</p>
    
    <br>
        <h3>Permission: "Phone - read phone status and identity"</h3>
    <p>(e.g. LocalCast, Drummer's Metronome or Microdyno)</p>
    <p>No app uses the identity at all. The app only uses the phone state. This means that it can react to incoming calls. E.g. it pauses the video or audio playback when someone calls you and resumes the playback when the call is finished.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Permission: "Microphone - record audio"</h3>
    <p> (e.g. Beat, Private Cam or Microdyno)</p>
    <p>The app can record audio, which is used in the app. No data is sent to a 3rd party, unless you choose to backup your data to Google Drive.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Permission: "Camera - take pictures and videos"</h3>
    <p>(e.g. Drummer's Metronome, Private Cam or Whisper)</p>
    <p>The app can take pictures or videos, which are used in the app. No data is sent to a 3rd party, unless you choose to backup your data to Google Drive.</p>
<br>
    <h3>If the app displays advertisements</h3>
    <p>The app uses Google's AdMob advertising service.
        <br>AdMob's privacy policy is available at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/</p>
<br>
    <h3>If the app has Google Analytics</h3>
    <p>The app displays a message, clearly stating that it collects anonymized data. This data will not be sold to or shared with a 3rd party. The analytics only have the purpose to make the app better and collect crash reports.
    <br>
